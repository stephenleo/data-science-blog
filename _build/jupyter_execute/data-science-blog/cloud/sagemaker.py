# 
# Major cost savings on ML endpoints with AWS Sagemaker!
# 
# - In the past when you deploy an ML model as a Real-Time Inference endpoint on Sagemaker, you‚Äôve had to keep the deployment instance running 24*7
# - This is a waste of money if your ML model receives sporadic traffic with some periods of 0 traffic as your instance is running idle
# 
# Enter Sagemaker serverless!
# 
# - During times when there is no traffic, Serverless Inference scales your endpoint down to 0, helping you to minimize your costs!
# - There will be some cold start when there is traffic after a long period of inactivity. In my experience with scikit-learn models, the cold start is <2s!
# - Implement with just one line of code change

# ## üöÄ AWS Sagemaker Inference
# 
# AWS Sagemaker is one of the easiest ways I‚Äôve come across for deploying Machine Learning models as a Data Scientist.
# 
# - Create a simple `serve.py` file with just four functions
# - model_fn: To load the model from a file
# - input_fn: Convert input JSON data into a pandas dataframe. Do any other preprocessing BEFORE model predictions here
# - predict_fn: Run the model predictions
# - output_fn: Post-process the predictions and convert them to JSON
# - As a pre-requisite, your trained model should be zipped as a tar.gz file on S3
# 
# Use the same `http://serve.py` for all of the below deployment methods!
# 
# - Real-time inference
# - Multi-model endpoint
# - Serverless inference (the topic of yesterday‚Äôs post)
# - Batch transform
# 
# The entire process is massively simplified if you use the JSON lines format (a topic for another post).
