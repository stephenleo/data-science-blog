# Top 5 ways to find datasets for your next Machine Learning project! 
# 
# Super convenient for those looking to build up a project portfolio to showcase to prospective hiring managers.
# 
# 1. Kaggle: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
# 2. Papers with code: [https://paperswithcode.com/datasets](https://paperswithcode.com/datasets). 
# 3. UCI machine learning repository: [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)
# 4. Huggingface datasets library: [https://huggingface.co/datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets). The most convenient with a standard interface. `pip install datasets`. See image.
# 5. Google dataset search: [https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/). Search for any kind of dataset across the entire internet.
# 
# Of course, for the closest experience into what real-world Data Science would look like, you should scrape the data by yourself from the internet, but hey, it's fun to play with a clean dataset!
