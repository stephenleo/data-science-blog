# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Pandas Profiling

Automate your exploratory data analysis (EDA) analysis with one line of
code!

-   When I start working on any new dataset, I subconsciously follow the
    same set of EDA steps to understand the data better.
-   The pandas‚Äô `#!python df.describe()` function is too basic for
    serious EDA work, so I manually create many plots and summary
    statistics. Most of the time, I need to Google for some specific
    syntax or solve some coding bug. All this makes the whole EDA
    process quite tedious at times.

Enter Pandas profiling!

-   Pandas profiling is an open-source Python library that automates
    many of those ‚Äúbest-known methods‚Äù in EDA to prepare a detailed
    interactive report with just 1 line of code!
-   You can then click through the various tabs and analyze the results
    without manually creating everything yourself. What a time saver!
-   Specifically, Pandas profiling automatically calculates column
    statistics, plots histograms, correlation coefficients, etc.
