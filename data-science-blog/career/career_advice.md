# üíº Career Advice

## üßë‚Äçüíª Coding manager

I still code ~30% of my time despite managing a team!

A while back, [Shilpa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABYyb4EBQTQdHJn1ueKgzEaD6P3ZYm7j_PQ) and I gave a talk to some Data Science students at General Assembly. One of the pieces of advice we gave students about what to expect from a career in Data Science is this:

- The single most significant thing I would like aspiring Data Scientists to come to terms with is that technology is evolving at a breakneck pace! Embarking on this data science or analytics career is a journey of continuous learning and not a destination.

- Taking my career as an example, I still code ~30% of my time despite managing a team at Edelman. I also learn new algorithms and techniques in my own free time and blog about them. I love learning new things and the fact that there is so much knowledge and technology out there to learn makes me both excited and humble.

- I hope that the students also enjoy learning new things and continue to keep learning the latest technology throughout their careers.

I am sharing this here for the wider community looking to break into this field. Having the right expectations will help prevent remorse when you eventually break into the field. All the best!

## üìÖ A Typical Week in the life of a Data Scientist

### Work:
1. Review your JIRA tickets to decide what to work on this week. Curse at the awful JIRA UI.
1. Read research papers on [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) or [Papers with Code](https://paperswithcode.com/). Feel smart when you realize you now read greek characters as fast as your native language.
1. Reading documentation of various frameworks. Swearing at how lousy their documentation is.
1. Coding. Realizing data cleanup will take about 80% of the project's timeline. Complain about how messy the data is.
1. Debugging. Frantically searching [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and hoping somebody else has resolved the same issue.
1. Run experiments. Complain about how slow training is even on the latest NVIDIA GPU.
1. Prepare fancy PowerPoints. Spend another 10% of the project's timeline preparing PowerPoint slides so that the non-ML business teams can understand what you're doing.
1. Refactor code and submit a pull request hoping over the hope that all tests pass and no one thinks your code is dumb.

### Meetings:
1. 1:1s with boss/reports
1. Daily/Weekly stand up meetings
1. Project update meetings with product teams
1. Code review meetings
1. Client meetings
1. Random meetings from some random person in the business asking for some random data extraction. They always assume it's a simple task, while in reality, you have to join 20 different tables with nasty nested queries.

## ü™• Data Curation

Data Scientists spend 80% (or more!) of their time collecting and cleaning up data in the real world. Preparing a clean, representative dataset is often more important than what algorithm you finally use to solve your problem.

Many people who join the industry get disappointed when they cannot work on the latest algorithms, but I'd like aspiring Data Scientists to accept that this is normal. A lot of value is unlocked not in using fancy algorithms but in structuring the data well enough to be used.

So do not get disappointed if you're spending a lot of your time in data cleaning. On the contrary, enjoy the process of wrangling data as every problem is a unique and challenging puzzle to be solved.
