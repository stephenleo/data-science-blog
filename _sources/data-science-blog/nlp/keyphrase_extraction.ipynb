    "## üìö Multi-Document Keyphrase Extraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-Document Keyphrase Extraction (MDKE) is the task of extracting important phrases from a collection of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "- MDKE can help analyze text clustering results to identify the important terms within each cluster of documents.\n",
    "- Contrary to single-document keyphrase extraction (SDKE), which has several well-known methods like RAKE, Text Rank, MultipartiteRank, and KeyBERT, MDKE is relatively under-studied in the literature.\n",
    "- The image below shows an example of SDKE in action.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper [\"Multi-Document Keyphrase Extraction: A Literature Review\"](https://lnkd.in/dc_ar8fk), the authors take two single-to-multi-document approaches as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Concat method: All the documents within a cluster are concatenated into a single big document and fed into the keyphrase extraction algorithm.\n",
    "- ‚úÖ Merge method: For each cluster, the keyphrase extraction algorithm is fed one document at a time, and keyphrases from all the individual documents are merged and ranked in descending order of their document frequency (the number of documents containing the keyphrase)\n",
    "- ‚úÖ There is some cleanup like stemming and de-duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of performance on their newly created dataset:\n",
    "- 1Ô∏è‚É£ In general, the Merge method tends to do better across most of the SDKE algorithms tested\n",
    "- 2Ô∏è‚É£ MultipartiteRank seems to be the best BUT is very slow and not very scalable in production\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus a good starting point for MDKE is:\n",
    "- 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pick any fast SDKE algorithm like Text Rank\n",
    "- 2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the algorithm on each document within your cluster\n",
    "- 3Ô∏è‚É£ Merge all the key phrases from all the documents in your cluster and rank them using the document frequency. You can use an IDF to penalize very frequent keyphrases too.\n",
