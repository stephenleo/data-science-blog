## Mintlify: Automated Documentation

🤔 What's the most boring part about coding? Arguably it's documentation! Well, fret not! You can now generate function docstrings automagically 🪄 with this amazing VSCode extension by [Mintlify](https://www.linkedin.com/company/mintsearch/)!!!

🔥 And yes! It works with Jupyter in VSCode too! One more reason to switch to VSCode for development

## Jupyter Magic Commands
I have a love-hate relationship with Jupyter notebooks. One of the things I love is magic commands! My top 3 favorite Jupyter notebook magic commands are...

1) `%%writefile <filename>` —> Writes the contents of the entire cell into `<filename>` file. Super useful to move all your helper functions to a `utils.py`

2) `%%time` —> Measures the execution time of the entire cell and prints it below. Super valuable for benchmark code in different cells

3) `%%bash` —> Run the contents of the entire cell as a bash script. Super helpful in environments where you don't have direct access to the terminal, such as in a Colab or Kaggle notebook
