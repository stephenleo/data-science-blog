## Download datasets for Machine Learning projects

Top 5 ways to find datasets for your next Machine Learning project!

Super convenient for those looking to build up a project portfolio to
showcase to prospective hiring managers.

1.  Kaggle: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets>
2.  Papers with code: <https://paperswithcode.com/datasets>.
3.  UCI machine learning repository:
    <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php>
4.  Huggingface datasets library: <https://huggingface.co/datasets>. The
    most convenient with a standard interface. `pip install datasets`.

5.  Google dataset search: <https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/>.
    Search for any kind of dataset across the entire internet.

Of course, for the closest experience into what real-world Data Science
would look like, you should scrape the data by yourself from the
internet, but hey, itâ€™s fun to play with a clean dataset!

## Labelstudio

Labelstudio is the best open-source data labeling tool Iâ€™ve come across.
You can use it to label several data modalities, including text, images,
audio, video, and time series.

Check it out for your next project, and give them a star if you found it
helpful!
