## Coding manager

I still code ~30% of my time despite managing a team!

A while back,
[Shilpa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ACoAABYyb4EBQTQdHJn1ueKgzEaD6P3ZYm7j_PQ)
and I gave a talk to some Data Science students at General Assembly. One
of the pieces of advice we gave students about what to expect from a
career in Data Science is this:

-   The single most significant thing I would like aspiring Data
    Scientists to come to terms with is that technology is evolving at a
    breakneck pace! Embarking on this data science or analytics career
    is a journey of continuous learning and not a destination.

-   Taking my career as an example, I still code ~30% of my time despite
    managing a team at Edelman. I also learn new algorithms and
    techniques in my own free time and blog about them. I love learning
    new things and the fact that there is so much knowledge and
    technology out there to learn makes me both excited and humble.

-   I hope that the students also enjoy learning new things and continue
    to keep learning the latest technology throughout their careers.

I am sharing this here for the wider community looking to break into
this field. Having the right expectations will help prevent remorse when
you eventually break into the field. All the best!

## A Typical Week in the life of a Data Scientist

### Work:

1.  Review your JIRA tickets to decide what to work on this week. Curse
    at the awful JIRA UI.
2.  Read research papers on [Semantic
    Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/) or [Papers with
    Code](https://paperswithcode.com/). Feel smart when you realize you
    now read greek characters as fast as your native language.
3.  Reading documentation of various frameworks. Swearing at how lousy
    their documentation is.
4.  Coding. Realizing data cleanup will take about 80% of the project‚Äôs
    timeline. Complain about how messy the data is.
5.  Debugging. Frantically searching
    [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and hoping somebody else
    has resolved the same issue.
6.  Run experiments. Complain about how slow training is even on the
    latest NVIDIA GPU.
7.  Prepare fancy PowerPoints. Spend another 10% of the project‚Äôs
    timeline preparing PowerPoint slides so that the non-ML business
    teams can understand what you‚Äôre doing.
8.  Refactor code and submit a pull request hoping over the hope that
    all tests pass and no one thinks your code is dumb.

### Meetings:

1.  1:1s with boss/reports
2.  Daily/Weekly stand-up meetings
3.  Project update meetings with product teams
4.  Code review meetings
5.  Client meetings
6.  Random meetings from some random person in the business asking for
    some random data extraction. They always assume it‚Äôs a simple task,
    while in reality, you have to join 20 different tables with nasty
    nested queries.

## Data Curation

Data Scientists spend 80% (or more!) of their time collecting and
cleaning up data in the real world. Preparing a clean, representative
dataset is often more important than what algorithm you finally use to
solve your problem.

Many people who join the industry get disappointed when they cannot work
on the latest algorithms, but I‚Äôd like aspiring Data Scientists to
accept that this is normal. A lot of value is unlocked not in using
fancy algorithms but in structuring the data well enough to be used.

So do not get disappointed if you‚Äôre spending a lot of your time in data
cleaning. On the contrary, enjoy the process of wrangling data as every
problem is a unique and challenging puzzle to be solved.

## Technology that saved my life as a data scientist

üíØ As a data scientist, 3 non-data sciency technologies saved my üçë¬†
countless times:

-   1Ô∏è‚É£¬†Bash Shell Scripting
-   2Ô∏è‚É£¬†Tmux
-   3Ô∏è‚É£¬†Docker

üëâ I highly recommend my team and students learn the basics. You can go
a long way with just Google searches and trial-and-error.

## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is changing the landscape of how candidates prepare to
tackle code interviews! Ethics aside, it‚Äôs a huge learning opportunity
in the absence of direct feedback from the hiring manager or a trusted
mentor.

If you‚Äôre a job seeker struggling to crack the coding interview, I
highly recommend the below steps.

-   Sign up for GitHub Copilot. It‚Äôs free (for now)
-   Practice some problems you‚Äôve struggled with in the past by first
    writing your own solution to it and then using Copilot to generate a
    solution independently.
-   Rigorously analyze the code generated by Copilot and why / if it
    solves your problem. Most importantly, see what‚Äôs different from the
    approach you took. You might discover a more elegant logic or some
    corner cases that you missed!
-   Press Ctrl + Enter to view other suggestions. Analyze them as well.
-   Over time, you‚Äôll learn a lot, so repeat the process on each problem
    you struggled with until you see that your solutions are comparable
    to or better than what Copilot suggests!

Et voil√†! You‚Äôre now a much better programmer than when you started.

## Headfake learning

Have you heard about Head-Fake learning?

Two months back, I wrote a popular blog post titled [‚ÄúMake Extra Money
on the Side With Data
Science!‚Äù](https://pub.towardsai.net/make-extra-money-on-the-side-with-data-science-984a623c53f5?sk=31e1a7794b073841e9ed66eeb1cc8867)
which was supposedly about how to earn a passive income from data
science projects.

In reality, my true intention in writing that article was NOT related to
making money but instead how to:

1.  Wrap a trained ML model into a FastAPI endpoint using Docker
2.  Deploy it using a serverless cloud run in Google Cloud

-   Compared to the rest of the topics in Data Science, these may seem
    dry, but they‚Äôre crucial to the success of a real-world Data Science
    team. Hence, the tangential but evergreen topic of making money on
    the side! I got the inspiration while brainstorming how to teach
    these topics to my previous part-time data science cohort at General
    Assembly.
-   In head-fake learning, you think you‚Äôre learning one thing when in
    reality, you‚Äôre learning something else that‚Äôs probably more
    valuable. The late Randy Pausch popularised head-fake learning in
    his [‚ÄúLast Lecture‚Äù](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo).
-   For example, when parents encourage kids to play sports, it‚Äôs not
    that they want their kids to become star athletes, but rather to
    develop skills like teamwork, sportsmanship, and perseverance in a
    fun way.
-   The next time you need to communicate something that might be dry
    and tedious, see if you can use a fun head-fake!

## Linkedin Early Apply

Did you know that if you pass the LinkedIn assessments for various
skills like Python, Machine Learning, etc, you get to apply early for
some jobs?

Not sure how much it helps, but something to boost your chances of
landing an interview.
